# Aithmetical Analysis

## Inspiration

Computational implementation of algorithms taught in Arithmetical Analysis lectures (341. Αριθμητική Ανάλυση (MATH341)) in National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (2022-2023).

## Notebooks

The interactive Pluto Notebooks can be utilized to observe the problem-solving process in Computer Arithmetic & Interpolation, making them excellent tools for both visualizing the subject matter and facilitating teaching. I encourage you to visit them [here](https://giannistsagkaropoulos.github.io/Arithmetical-Analysis/) and to use them for your educational benefit.

## Code examples

The provided code examples are intended for illustration purposes and adhere to 4 key principles:

1. It closely mirrors the mathematical expressions taught symbolically in the lecture.
2. It strives to minimize code length, making it easily comprehensible.
3. It does not require prior programming expertise.
4. It prioritizes efficient execution.
